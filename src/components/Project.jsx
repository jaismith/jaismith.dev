        Dartmouth College is currently undergoing a multi-million dollar campus-wide upgrade to WiFi infrastructure. In order to prioritize upcoming building upgrades in high-traffic areas, Dartmouth ITC hired the DALI Lab to build a WiFi reporting tool that taps into Dartmouthâ€™s networking data to track issues and overloaded access points. This project is in the final stages of development and will be publically launched later this Spring.
